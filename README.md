# Spambase

[Link to Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/conleydg/spambase/blob/master/Spambase.ipynb)

#### The above linked Jupyter Notebook attempts to use spam filtering data to create a model that can learn how to filter emails.

The first part of the Jupyter Notebook reads in the previous spam email data.  I then split that data into two sections.  The first section is 60% of the total data and is used to train the model.  Once the model is trained the remaining 40% of data is used to test how well our model can predict whether or not an email contains spam.
